				<h2>Assignment 1</h2>
				<div class="post-date">10/9/2016</div>
				
				<p>
					The most challenging aspect of this assignment was understanding the difference
					between block and inline elements. I had problems styling the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>
					elements because I didn't realize that they were inline.
					When I added horizontal padding or margins to these elements,
					it did not affect the containing <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element.
					I solved this problem by creating a minimal example,
					and asking my knowledgable classmates on Piazza, who were able to quickly
					identify the problem.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The most incredible thing I learned from the assignment was how to make the round
					buttons, like the "add note" button.
					If I had seen a button like that before, I would have thought that it was
					an image.
					The fact that you can make a button like that with pure CSS opened my eyes to its
					power. I now wonder what other elements around the web are done in pure CSS.
					Could I reproduce Google's "waiting" animation with CSS?
					There were some elements of the assignment that I already knew;
					doing the CSS hover rules, for example, was old hat.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					As always, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">w3schools.com</a> was
					an amazing resource.
					Additionally, my classmates on Piazza were very helpful as well.
					When using Piazza, I always tried to create a minimal example of my problem
					and to explain the exact problem I was having, what I tried, and what the precise
					error was.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Two things I had to Google to complete the assignment were how to:
					<ol>
						<li>create a round button in pure CSS
						<li>use flex boxes
					</ol>
					The only reason I had to Google these items, though, is because I tried to complete
					the assignment before the lecture on these topics.

				<h2>What I learned doing Assignment 0</h2>
				<div class="post-date">9/22/2016</div>
			
				<p>
					I've done a little bit of HTML before. So, in order to enhance by own learning,
					I gave myself two extra objectives when doing this assignment:			
					<ol>
						<li>Use only HTML5 compliant code.
						<li>Make the site look nice without using CSS (because CSS isn't allowed yet).
					</ol>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					These seemed like some very simple objectives to begin with, but most of the HTML
					that I learned before (in the HTML4 days) is not compatible with HTML5!
					This makes sense, because HTML5 was designed to use with CSS, but without CSS
					my hands are tied in so many ways. For example, there is a huge white space
					between the title of this post and the date, but without CSS, I can't adjust
					the style of the header. Well, maybe I can use the &lt;font&gt; tag instead of
					the &lt;h2&gt; tag so it doesn't put a huge vertical whitespace underneath it, right?
					Nope, &lt;font&gt; doesn't exist in HTML5. I can't even change the
					background without using CSS!
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Overall, I really came to appreciate how much was removed in the transition
					between HTML4 and HTML5. This makes sense, because so much functionality in
					HTML5 is supposed to be handled by CSS, but I never quite fully grasped the
					scope of the changes before now.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I used <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">w3schools.com</a> as a reference
					as I worked on this assignment. Mostly, I used it to figure out which
					tag attributes are no longer supported in HTML5 (turns out, a lot).
					I use it because it is a clear, easy to use website.
					Also, it always comes up first or second when doing Google searches for any
					basic web related things!

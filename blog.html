				<h2>Assignment 3</h2>
				<div class="post-date">11/2/2016</div>

				<p>
					This assignment was relatively easy. It was a simple matter of 
					referencing the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/http.html">
					documentation for the http module</a> and fillout out the
					right callback functions.
					The only hiccup I encountered during this assignment
					was during the cache process. It was a little tricky
					to get a cached document <em>and</em> return the appropriate
					status code.
					I worked around this problem by having the cache function
					fill out the response object itelf. The other solution
					would involve having the cache function return an object
					with the file contents and the status code, but I already had an
					object (the response object), so why not just use that?
				</p>

				<p>
					To complete this assignment, I mosty used the documentation
					on <a href="https://nodejs.org">nodejs.org</a>.

				<h2>Assignment 2</h2>
				<div class="post-date">10/16/2016</div>
				
				<p>
					This assignment was fairly straightforward. The only challenging bit was figuring
					out exactly which function I needed to do different things. As always,
					<a href="http://www.w3schools.com">w3schools</a> was an excellent resource.
					I also used <a href="http://caniuse.com">caniuse.com</a> to get compatability
					information for JavaScript's for-each construct.
				</p>
				
				<p>					
					One interesting thing I learned was the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCollection">
					HTMLCollection</a> object. At first, I was using <code>Document.getElementsByClassName()</code>
					to get items from the page. This returns an HTMLCollection, not a list, so I had to write
					a custom for-each function for it to do what I wanted to easily. I ended up not using
					this function, and using a <code>querySelectorAll()</code> call instead
					(because <code>querySelectorAll()</code> supports for-each out of the box), but it was
					stil very interesting reading about the <code>HTMLCollection</code>.
					Apparently, the <code>HTMLCollection</code> is a <em>live</em> collection
					of DOM objects, meaning that it will be automatically updated when a new object that
					meets the criteria is formed. Upon researching this function, I learned that
					it is a <em>lot</em> faster than <code>getElementsByClassName()</code>, because it hardly
					has to do any preprocessing at all. Well, my assignment 2 already uses <code>querySelectorAll</code>,
					and it works fine, so will keep this in mind for later projects.

				<h2>Assignment 1</h2>
				<div class="post-date">10/9/2016</div>
				
				<p>
					The most challenging aspect of this assignment was understanding the difference
					between block and inline elements. I had problems styling the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>
					elements because I didn't realize that they were inline.
					When I added horizontal padding or margins to these elements,
					it did not affect the containing <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element.
					I solved this problem by creating a minimal example,
					and asking my knowledgable classmates on Piazza, who were able to quickly
					identify the problem.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The most incredible thing I learned from the assignment was how to make the round
					buttons, like the "add note" button.
					If I had seen a button like that before, I would have thought that it was
					an image.
					The fact that you can make a button like that with pure CSS opened my eyes to its
					power. I now wonder what other elements around the web are done in pure CSS.
					Could I reproduce Google's "waiting" animation with CSS?
					There were some elements of the assignment that I already knew;
					doing the CSS hover rules, for example, was old hat.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					As always, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">w3schools.com</a> was
					an amazing resource.
					Additionally, my classmates on Piazza were very helpful as well.
					When using Piazza, I always tried to create a minimal example of my problem
					and to explain the exact problem I was having, what I tried, and what the precise
					error was.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Two things I had to Google to complete the assignment were how to:
					<ol>
						<li>create a round button in pure CSS
						<li>use flex boxes
					</ol>
					The only reason I had to Google these items, though, is because I tried to complete
					the assignment before the lecture on these topics.

				<h2>What I learned doing Assignment 0</h2>
				<div class="post-date">9/22/2016</div>
			
				<p>
					I've done a little bit of HTML before. So, in order to enhance by own learning,
					I gave myself two extra objectives when doing this assignment:			
					<ol>
						<li>Use only HTML5 compliant code.
						<li>Make the site look nice without using CSS (because CSS isn't allowed yet).
					</ol>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					These seemed like some very simple objectives to begin with, but most of the HTML
					that I learned before (in the HTML4 days) is not compatible with HTML5!
					This makes sense, because HTML5 was designed to use with CSS, but without CSS
					my hands are tied in so many ways. For example, there is a huge white space
					between the title of this post and the date, but without CSS, I can't adjust
					the style of the header. Well, maybe I can use the &lt;font&gt; tag instead of
					the &lt;h2&gt; tag so it doesn't put a huge vertical whitespace underneath it, right?
					Nope, &lt;font&gt; doesn't exist in HTML5. I can't even change the
					background without using CSS!
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Overall, I really came to appreciate how much was removed in the transition
					between HTML4 and HTML5. This makes sense, because so much functionality in
					HTML5 is supposed to be handled by CSS, but I never quite fully grasped the
					scope of the changes before now.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I used <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">w3schools.com</a> as a reference
					as I worked on this assignment. Mostly, I used it to figure out which
					tag attributes are no longer supported in HTML5 (turns out, a lot).
					I use it because it is a clear, easy to use website.
					Also, it always comes up first or second when doing Google searches for any
					basic web related things!
